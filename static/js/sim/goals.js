// ─── goals.js ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// When a plan meets the user's goals. A goal is one rule (plan.js has its
// shape): a measure, compared with a target, maybe by a deadline:
//
//   "Net worth is at least 25 times yearly expenses by age 65"
//
// Goals are shared by all plans, so each function takes the plan to measure
// and the goals to measure it by. Pure, like the engine: no DOM, no clock, no
// randomness.
//
//   horizon(plan)                              the plan as goals are judged on
//                                              it: run over the longest length a
//                                              plan can have, whatever length is
//                                              being viewed
//   evaluate(plan, results, goals, { real })   one status per goal, read off a
//                                              run, with how close the plan
//                                              comes to it
//
// A goal asks whether a plan EVER meets it, so its status must not change
// with the length on show (the length chips). Simulate horizon(plan) and
// evaluate that run for any status the user reads; a shorter run serves only
// views that mark months inside it (Analyze's goal flags).
//
// The measures, at each balance point k (0..months, the moment month k-1 ends,
// where the net worth series is recorded):
//
//   net-worth   net worth
//   savings     every account's balance plus Unassigned ("account balance")
//   debt        everything owed
//   expenses    a year of spending and loan payments: the twelve months before
//               the point, or the plan's first twelve for points inside them
//               (a shorter plan's months scaled up to a year). Card payments
//               are left out: what a card buys is spending already.
//   income      a year of take-home pay (earned less withholding), the same way
//
// A goal is met at the first point its rule holds: on time (or early) when
// that point is at or before its deadline's, late when after it, and unmet
// when the rule never holds in the run. A rule that reads a year of income or
// expenses in a plan that has none is `blocked`, a goal the plan cannot
// measure (there is nothing to compare), as is an age deadline in a plan
// whose age is not set.
//
// With `real`, money is measured in the plan's first month's money (deflated
// at the plan's inflation); an amount in a rule is then taken in today's
// money too. The page measures as of each month (real off).
//
// Dual-environment: window.CitrineGoals in the page, CommonJS for the tests.

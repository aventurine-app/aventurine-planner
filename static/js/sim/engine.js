// ─── engine.js ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The simulator. Runs a plan month by month and returns every balance and
// every flow. Pure: the same plan always gives the same numbers. No clock, no
// randomness, no DOM, so it runs live in the renderer on every edit and under
// node --test unchanged.
//
// One month, in order:
//   1. Debts that start this month become owed, and their proceeds are paid
//      out along their proceeds links. A loan secured by an asset brings the
//      asset in with it.
//   2. Balances move. Accounts earn (or lose) at their rate and keep it;
//      debts accrue interest; assets appreciate. Cards make their purchases.
//   3. Income arrives and is split along their links. Money keeps
//      moving through spending and modifiers until it comes to rest. An
//      account keeps whatever arrives.
//   4. Scheduled moves out of account balances run (withdrawals, shares,
//      sweeps), upstream accounts first, so a transfer made early in the pass
//      is seen by the accounts below it in the same month.
//   5. The month's balances are recorded.
//
// Rates. An account's rate is an effective annual rate (APY): a 4% account
// grows by exactly 4% over twelve months. A debt's rate is an APR charged
// monthly at APR/12, which is how cards and loans quote it.
//
// Pre-tax contributions. Income sent to a 401(k), an HSA or a Traditional IRA
// is taken from gross pay before withholding, so only what is left is taxed.
// Every percentage from an income is a share of the same paycheck, so they
// add up together: 10% to a 401(k) and 90% to a bank account is all of it.
// A pre-tax share goes in whole; any other share is withheld on the way out
// (90% of gross pay, less withholding). Fixed amounts and the rest are
// take-home pay, except a fixed amount into a pre-tax account.
//
// Employer match. A 401(k)'s Employer match is the share of each contribution
// the employer adds, up to its yearly match limit. Only pay sent straight from
// income is matched (not transfers from other accounts), and the match is new
// money: it does not count toward the account's yearly contribution limit.
//
// Overdrawing. A fixed amount out of an account's balance is drawn in full,
// even past zero: the account goes negative (and earns nothing while it is)
// rather than the payment falling short, and the plan is flagged `overdrawn`
// from the first month it ends below zero. The other ways out of a balance
// (a share of it, the rest) are measured against what it holds, so they take
// nothing from an empty or overdrawn account.
//
// Minimum balance. An account's Keep at least is a floor for those other ways
// out: a share or the rest is measured against only what is over it, so a
// checking account that keeps $4,000 splits each paycheck and leaves the
// $4,000 alone. An account below its minimum keeps what arrives until it is
// back up to it. A fixed amount is still drawn in full (a bill is paid), and
// the plan is flagged `below-minimum` from the first month an account that had
// reached its minimum ends below it.
//
// Two-way links. A link between two accounts may have a way back, out of the
// target's balance into the source, with the same rules as any balance link,
// running side by side with the way out.
//
// Starting. Each side of a link starts now or when its condition is first met
// (plan.js, Starting): an age, or an account's balance at the top of a month
// reaching an amount. A fixed amount rises each year from its start. A side
// that never starts (no plan age, no account picked, a size never reached) is
// flagged `no-start`.
//
// Stopping. A side may stop when a condition of the same kinds is first met;
// it does not run from that month on. A two-way link's way out can stop at
// retirement as its way back starts. One that cannot be met (an age missing,
// no account picked) runs on and is flagged `no-stop`.
//
// Stopping income. A salary or paycheck may be set to stop: its Last paid
// month is the last it pays, and stopping at an age it pays up to the month
// before the plan's person turns that age (plan.js, incomeEnd). Without the
// plan's age set, an age stop is flagged `stop-no-age`, and a stop at the
// retirement age without it set `stop-no-retire-age`; either runs on.
//
// Expense costs. An expense may have a cost of its own, on a schedule like
// income's (every month, a yearly lump, once) and rising by its inflation rate
// each year from when it starts. A link set to the cost pays exactly what falls
// due that month: it is a fixed amount whose size and timing come from the
// expense, so it overdraws, charges a card and falls short like any fixed one.
// Setting a link to the cost is optional: whatever links feed an expense, the
// plan is flagged `cost-uncovered` when what comes in over the plan is less
// than the cost that falls due.
//
// Paying debts. A payment never exceeds what is owed: once a debt is paid off,
// the money its links would have sent stays with the payer and falls through
// to the payer's later links (its rest, usually savings). A debt that has its
// own Overpayment links is the exception: that is a snowball, and the freed
// payments go on along them instead. (Only loans have them. A card is paid
// down and no further: what it cannot take stays with the payer.)
//
// Credit limits. A card with a limit never charges past it: purchases are held
// to the credit left (limit less balance owed). On a card, a percent link
// charges that share of the limit each time it fires and a rest link charges
// whatever credit is left after the others. Without a limit neither charges
// anything. A card owing more than 30% of its limit at the month's peak (after
// purchases, before payments) is flagged as `utilization`.
//
// Assets. A loan's Asset value is the home or car it is secured by. The asset
// counts toward net worth from the start (or, for a loan that starts inside the
// plan, from the month it is bought) and changes each month at its
// Appreciation rate, an effective annual rate like an account's. That change
// is growth. No money flows into or out of it: what was paid for it was
// spending, and its arrival is `acquired`. It stays after the loan is paid off.
//
// Conservation. Money enters only as income, an employer
// match, cash back, growth or a loan's proceeds, and leaves only as spending,
// a tax or fee, or debt interest. A credit card's annual fee is a fee: it is added to the
// balance owed, so it lowers net worth the month it is charged. Money with nowhere to go lands in the Unassigned pool, which
// counts toward net worth. So the change in net worth always equals
//   income - withholding + match + cash back + growth + acquired - interest - spent - taxes/fees
// and the test suite checks that identity on every scenario.
